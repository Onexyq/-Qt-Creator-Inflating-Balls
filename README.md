Inflating Balls
@Description: This is a starter level game project game called 'The Inflating Balls' created using Qt creator C++ ver. In this game you will take control of a Ball and try to "eat" enemie balls in order to earn scores; At the same time do your best to avoid be eaten by your bigger enemies. The basic idea comes from a game named 'Feeding frenzy' .

@In single-player mode, you will need to earn enough score to win the game . However, the two-player mode is rather competitive and challenging: you also has the option to "eat" your opponent to win.

@Technically, this is a simple game but engage a lot of ideas in C++ programing as well as GUI design. In C++ 11, for instance, the use of Inheritance/Polymorphism, STL, Lambda, Multithread, etc. In Qt framework, the use of signals/slots, Plugins such as Piximap, KeyEvents, Audio, etc.

@Future Usage: One can create a game more interesting and challenging by adding new features to this one. For example, 'Battle City' by adding code for projectiles, 'Pac-Man' by adding barriers, or even a online multiplyer version
by adding a web server.ime.
